# Inert 2 Higgs Doublet Model (i2HDM)

This repository holds all the information that served for the construction of the i2HDM project. The inert two-Higgs-doublet model (i2HDM) is a theoretically well-motivated example of a minimal consistent dark matter (DM) model which provides monojet, mono-Z, mono-Higgs, and vector-bosonfusion +  E^miss_T signatures at the LHC, complemented by signals in direct and indirect DM search experiments. In this paper we have performed a detailed analysis of the constraints in the full five-dimensional parameter space of the i2HDM, coming from perturbativity, unitarity, electroweak precision
data, Higgs data from the LHC, DM relic density, direct/indirect DM detection, and LHC monojet analysis, as well as implications of experimental LHC studies on disappearing charged tracks relevant to a high DM mass region. We demonstrate the complementarity of the above constraints and present projections for future LHC data and direct DMdetection experiments to probe further i2HDM parameter space. The model is implemented into the CalcHEP and MicrOMEGAS packages, which are publicly available at the [HEPMDB](https://hepmdb.soton.ac.uk/) database, and it is ready for a further exploration in the context of the LHC, relic density, and DM direct detection.
