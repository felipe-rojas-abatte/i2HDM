Report of the Referee -- DC12096/Belyaev
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It is a pleasure to read this interesting paper. This work has done
mostly updated work for Inert Higgs Doublet Model (i2HDM). Indeed, I
agree with author that the parameter space of i2HDM is more or less
pined down by using the constraints from perturbativity, unitarity, DM
relic density, direct detection, EW precision test, LEP result, and
LHC Higgs data. Because of fewer free parameters and their correlated
relationship, seen from this paper, the model is ready to be tested in
LHC as benchmark scenario and it is right time that experimentalists
should also pay attention on this model.



Generally speaking, I would like recommend this paper to be published
in PRD but there are still some issues which I hope the authors can
improve before publishing.

Main suggestions:

=================================================================================

1) In Ref. [29], they claim that the perturbativity and unitarity is
more reliable by using the code 2HDMC than Ref. [51] and [60],
especially for HHHH vertex. However, since the author does not use
2HDMC instead of the conditions presented in Ref. [51] and [60], I
suggest the authors shall also check whether is there some parameter
space not properly tested.

Reply:

We have explicitly checked that the limit
from perturbative unitarity and perturbativity given by Eq.(13)-(16) we are using in our study is
consistent with that implemented in the 2HDMC code[68].
We have added the respective reference and sentense to an updated version of the paper.
Moreover, we would like to note that in our paper we present the limit on $\lambda_2$ (or $\lambda_{HHHH}$  -- notation from [29])
as a function of $\lambda_{345}$ pictorially presented in Figure 2 which goes beyond findings in [29].


=================================================================================

2) The authors mentioned:

"A related question is whether the model can be better probed by
indirect detection (ID) experiments, i.e. the detection of energetic
cosmic rays like positron, gamma ray, and antiproton, which may be
created by the annihilation of h1 pairs. ..., but the bounds are not
competitive with those coming from DD."

Recently, the new AMS02 antiproton data seems to have some interesting
behavior, see Ref. [1610.03071] and [1610.03840]. This could put some
significant impact on i2HDM parameter space. I suggest the authors can
add some discussion and estimation about this.

We have checked that the strongest bounds on the i2HDM
parameter space coming from such experiments are set by gamma ray telescopes: both the Fermi-
LAT gamma-ray space telescope [84] as well as ground based telescopes. Fermi-LAT is sensitive
to gamma rays particularly in the low mass range up to O(100 GeV), but the bounds are not
competitive with those coming from DD. This conclusion is also confirmed by studies in Ref. [60].
The paper was updated respectively with this sentence.



1705.01458 indirect detection
=================================================================================

3) The new allowed region (almost mh1~mh2 and la345~0) discovered by
the authors shall be identified and more emphasized.

I was interesting in this region and trying to see how this region can
be survived but in the end I only found the BM1 at the Table 1. Since
this is the new region claimed by the authors, some more information
shall be given.

I suspect the relic density of most this region are always too low
from PLANCK data. For example, the BM1 has the relic density 0.092 and
chi^2 based on Eq. (29) are 484 which is not good for thermal relic
scenario! If my guess is true, the authors shall mention whether is
this new region owing to the non-thermal relic assumption?
=================================================================================

4) Again, I was so looking forward to seeing the result about the life
time of h+ and the limit of delta M in the last paragraph of Section
3. However, the authors disappoint me by only using one paragraph with
a lot of hand-waving. I think the authors shall present this part with
useful figure(s). Otherwise, it is hard to drive me trust the sentence
written in the conclusion:

"At the same time, the potential of the LHC using a search for
disappearing charged tracks is quite impressive in probing Mh1 masses
up to about 500 GeV already at 8 TeV with 19.5 fb-1 luminosity as we
have found in our study."

=================================================================================
Other suggestions:

(i) The text is well organized and very enjoyably readable only before
section 3

but it becomes messy and hard to read after section 4. Especially, in
the result section, many information/concepts/reasons are given
scatteringly and all the figures are listed in the back. I believe
that the authors should be able to make it much clear in the
presentation. For example, they can use bullets, items, and tables for
classification and comparison.

In addition, I strongly suggest the authors to locate their figures
before the text. The figure location can also help reader. Some less
important figures can be integrated into an appendix.

(ii) Missing the space (Fig.20, Fig.21)
